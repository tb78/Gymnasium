## 📌 Overview

**Position Sizer MT5/MT4** is a risk management tool designed for traders who want precise control over every trade.

Instead of guessing lot sizes, the system calculates everything automatically based on your risk tolerance and setup.

Built with a modern desktop UI inspired by professional trading platforms.

---

## ⚙️ What It Does

The application calculates optimal position sizing and visualizes trade risk in real time:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| Lot Size | Automatically calculated based on risk and stop loss distance |
| Risk Amount | Exact dollar value at risk per trade |
| Reward Amount | Potential profit based on take profit level |
| Risk/Reward Ratio | Ratio between potential reward and risk |
| Stop Distance | Calculated in pips depending on instrument |
| Pip Value | Adjusted per symbol (Forex, Gold, JPY pairs) |

## ✨ Features

---

## 🧩 Interface

The application is structured into key sections:

- Sidebar — navigation and system overview  
- Trade Parameters — balance, risk %, entry, SL, TP  
- Results Panel — lot size, risk, reward, R:R  
- Risk Meter — visual exposure gauge  
- Trade History — executed trades  

---

## 🧠 Calculation Logic

```
Risk Amount = Account Balance × Risk %

Lot Size = Risk Amount / (StopLoss Pips × Pip Value)

Reward = Lot Size × TakeProfit Pips × Pip Value

R:R Ratio = Reward / Risk
```

---

## 📉 Risk Visualization

The built-in **Risk Meter** gives instant feedback:

- Low Risk → below 1.5%  
- Moderate Risk → 1.5% – 3%  
- High Risk → above 3%  

Helps prevent overexposure and poor risk decisions.
