## 🚨 The Problem Every Trader Knows

> *"Market is crashing. You need to close everything. Now."*
>
> You open MT5 — close position 1, close position 2, cancel order 1, cancel order 2...
>
> **By the time you're done, the damage is done.**

MT5 Auto Scripts gives you a single button to close every open position and cancel every pending order across your entire account — instantly, with a clean confirmation flow and real-time feedback.

## What It Does

**Close All Orders Script** connects to your active MT5 session and performs the following in sequence:

1. Reads all open market positions from the account
2. Sends a close request for each position at the current market price
3. Reads all pending orders (limit, stop, stop-limit)
4. Cancels every pending order individually
5. Verifies each closure and reports the final result

The entire process takes a few seconds and gives you step-by-step progress feedback throughout.

## Features

| Feature | Description |

| Close All Positions | Closes every open market position regardless of symbol, direction, or volume |
| Cancel All Pending Orders | Removes all limit, stop, and stop-limit orders from the account |
| Multi-Symbol Support | Works across forex pairs, metals, indices, crypto — any instrument on your MT5 broker |
| Pre-Execution Preview | Before running, the app shows a full table of every position and order that will be affected |
| Confirmation Requirement | The Run button stays disabled until you explicitly check the confirmation box — no accidents |
| Live Connection Status | Sidebar shows your MT5 server name, login ID, and live connection state at all times |
| Animated Progress Bar | Each step of the script is shown in real time: connect → close positions → cancel orders → verify → done |
| Disconnect / Reconnect | Toggle your MT5 connection directly from the sidebar without restarting the app |
| Real-Time Status Bar | Bottom bar shows the current operation and a live clock |

## 🛡️ Safety Design

This tool handles irreversible trading actions, so it was designed with several layers of protection:

- **Confirmation gate** — the Run button is visually disabled and non-clickable until the user ticks the acknowledgement checkbox
- **Order preview** — a full grid of all open positions and pending orders is displayed before any action is taken, so you always know exactly what will be closed
- **Connection check** — if MT5 is disconnected, the script refuses to run and shows a warning in the status bar
- **Warning banner** — a clearly visible red warning reminds the user that the action cannot be undone
- **No auto-run** — the script never runs automatically; every execution requires a manual trigger

---
